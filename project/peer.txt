DominAI: A Dominoes-Playing AI
Guillermo Andres Angeris, Lucy Li

Their project was to make a Dominoes Player that could function despite the fact that the player has to deal with imperfect information. What I liked about their poster was that they put pseudocode on their poster, so that you can clearly see what their algorithm is doing as to have a better idea.

Sai Vignesh Saravana Senthilkumar, Chase Brandon, Micah Daniel Silberstein

Their project was to be able to predict Basketball games well enough to “beat Vegas”. What I really liked was that they could take their project and use it for real world purposes if they were to actually use it to bet.
